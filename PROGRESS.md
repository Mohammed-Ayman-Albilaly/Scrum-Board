# PROGRESS.md — ScrumBoard Build Status

> Source of truth for "where did we leave off." Read this + CLAUDE.md + PRD.md at the
> start of every session, before touching code. See CLAUDE.md → "Start of Every Session"
> and "Commit-as-Contract Workflow" for when this file gets updated.

## How to use this file

1. **Starting a session:** read the table below, then run `git status` and
   `git log --oneline -10` and reconcile them against this file. This file only reflects
   what was **committed and pushed** — uncommitted work on someone else's machine won't
   be visible to you, and this file can lag behind reality if the last session forgot to
   update it.
2. **Finishing a stage:** flip the relevant cell in the table, update "In Progress /
   Blockers" if needed, and commit `PROGRESS.md` **in the same commit** as the stage's
   code (same `feat:` / `security:` / `test:` commit — don't add a separate "update
   progress" commit).
3. **Stopping mid-stage (including running out of tokens/budget):** do not mark the stage
   done. Instead, commit whatever is safe to commit, and write a note under "In Progress /
   Blockers" describing exactly what's done, what's half-done, and what's still only on
   disk (uncommitted). Push before ending the session — a teammate's agent can only resume
   from what's on the remote.

## Feature status

Reconciled 2026-07-15 against the actual remote (`HEAD` = `95920ab`), which committed and
pushed all the WIP a previous entry of this file had described as "uncommitted." The
earlier entry predated that commit; the table below reflects what is genuinely on GitHub.

| **Per-project roles** (multi-role, union perms) | ✅ (signup slimmed; `ctx.roles`; invite+members dialogs) | ✅ (`project_member_role`, migration 0004 w/ data copy, `requireRole` union check, SM-only invite + `PATCH roles`) | ✅ `security-review-per-project-roles.md` | ✅ `roles.test.ts` (9) — 71/71 | 🟡 (pending push) |
| **Dashboard / profile / contacts / avatar** | 🟡 (dashboard.html + profile.html + header.js w/ avatar popover; login → /dashboard.html; board reads `?projectId=`) | ⬜ (`GET /users/contacts`, `PATCH /users/me`) | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |

**Multi-project (done 2026-07-15):** every user auto-enrolls in the shared `Team Project` on
signup and can create more projects or invite existing users by email. A `project_member` join
table + `requireProjectMember` middleware scope every board/story/sprint/ceremony/users request
to a project the caller belongs to (cross-project access → 403). Global `user.role` still governs
RBAC *within* each project; a per-project role model is a possible future layer.

**Auth-stack deviation (accepted):** the PRD names *bcrypt + express-session*; the app uses
**Better Auth** (scrypt hashing, HttpOnly/SameSite=Strict session cookies) per CLAUDE.md. This
satisfies "passwords hashed, never plaintext" and is tested + security-reviewed. Kept as the
MVP choice — switching would discard the working, reviewed auth stack.

## In progress / uncommitted right now

**2026-07-16 — 4-change feature set underway** (approved plan: dialog system → per-project
roles → dashboard/profile → header/logout cleanup, each via the 5-stage pipeline).
**Change 4 (dialog system) complete through QA**: `scripts/dialog.js`
(confirm/danger/input/custom variants, native `<dialog>`-based); all 5 native
`confirm()`/`prompt()` call sites replaced. Backend suite unaffected — typecheck clean +
63/63 tests green on 2026-07-16. Manual dialog checklist (delete story, rename story,
create project, invite member, close sprint, plus Esc/cancel/backdrop paths) to be
exercised in-browser alongside Change 1's board work.

**Change 1 (per-project roles), frontend + backend stages committed.** Roles now live in
`project_member_role` (PK project+user+role; multi-role; permissions = union).
`user.role` is DROPPED by migration 0004, which first copies each member's global role
into a role row for every project they belong to (data-copy ordering verified by dry-run:
INSERT…SELECT runs before the column drop; role-row count == membership count).
`requireProjectMember` pins `req.projectRoles`; `requireRole` checks the union against it
(all 5 gate sites unchanged). Signup takes name/email/password only and enrolls into the
default project as TEAM_MEMBER; project creators (founders) get SCRUM_MASTER; invites +
role edits (`PATCH /projects/:id/members/:userId/roles`) are SM-only. Test harness
refitted (fixtures carry `roles` arrays; `signIn` grants them via direct DB insert).
**Change 1 complete through QA**: security review committed
(`security-review-per-project-roles.md`) and `roles.test.ts` adds 9 tests (founder
bootstrap, SM-only invites + PATCH roles incl. cross-project 403s, role-set validation,
union permissions, per-project scoping) — **71/71 green**. ⚠️ Run `pnpm db:migrate`
after pulling. Next: Change 2 (dashboard/profile/contacts/avatar). Everything above is committed **and pushed to `origin/main`**
on 2026-07-16. **Verified green locally on 2026-07-15** with a portable Node + pnpm 9.15.0,
and additionally **exercised live in a browser** against the running dev server (project switch,
sprint dates on the header, backlog reorder, structured Planning + Retro rendering):

- `pnpm --filter backend typecheck` — exit 0, no type errors
- `pnpm --filter backend test` — **63/63 passing** across 8 files: `auth` 13, `board` 12,
  `permissions` 6, `assignees` 8, `sprint_dates` 4, `reorder` 5, `ceremonies` 7, `projects` 8

(The auth negative-path tests emit expected `Invalid password` / `User not found` warnings
from Better Auth — those are asserted-for behavior, not failures.)

**Pushed + CI green:** all assignee / sprint-date / reorder / structured-ceremony / multi-project
work is on `origin/main`, and the GitHub Actions `CI` run for the head commit is **green**
(install → typecheck → `vitest run`, 63/63). Note: CI had been red on every prior run — including
the baseline `95920ab` — because the workflow pinned `version: 9` while `package.json` already
declares `packageManager: pnpm@9.15.0`, so `pnpm/action-setup@v4` aborted at the *Install pnpm*
step. Fixed by dropping the explicit `version:` input.

## Known gaps / next candidates

Every PRD feature is now implemented. Remaining items are refinements, not missing flows:

- ~~**Story assignees**~~ **Done 2026-07-15.**
- ~~**Backlog reordering**~~ **Done 2026-07-15** — `PATCH /stories/:id/reorder` + ▲/▼ controls.
- ~~**Structured retro / ceremonies**~~ **Done 2026-07-15** — per-type fields, Retro 3-col board.
- ~~**Multi-project support**~~ **Done 2026-07-15** — projects + membership + scoping.
- **Multiple assignees.** Single `assigneeId` today; "Assignee(s)" hints at multiple (needs a
  story⇄user junction table).
- **Per-project roles.** Role is global (`user.role`); a per-project owner/admin role would let
  projects restrict who can invite. Any member can currently invite.
- **bcrypt vs Better Auth.** Documented, accepted deviation (see the auth-stack note above).
- **Legacy `ceremony.notes` column.** Superseded by `details`; left in place (always null) to
  keep migration 0002 additive. Drop in a later migration if desired.

## Resolved blockers (kept for history)

- ~~Architecture drift: CLAUDE.md documented a `features/columns/` folder.~~ **Resolved
  2026-07-15** by updating CLAUDE.md's file tree to match reality — the "move story between
  sub-columns" mutation lives at `PATCH /stories/:id/move` inside `features/stories/`; there
  is no `columns/` folder.
- ~~`backend/package.json` had no `"test"` script.~~ **Resolved** — `"test": "vitest run"`
  is present; `pnpm --filter backend test` works.
- ~~No CI pipeline.~~ **Resolved** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `pnpm install
  --frozen-lockfile`, typecheck, then the test suite on every push to `main` and every PR.

## Next up

All PRD features are implemented, security-reviewed, covered by 63 passing tests, pushed to
`origin/main`, and green on GitHub Actions CI. Next step: pick a refinement from "Known gaps"
(multiple assignees or per-project roles are the strongest).
